 IMPORTANT USAGE INFORMATION
 
 Use this file only with the indicated device. Any other combination
 is invalid. Do not modify this file except in regions designated for
 "user" constraints. This file is valid only with the default input delay
 buffer settings as described in the implementation guide.

 Additionally, the generated UCF file assumes that the PCI/PCIX core is
 instantiated with a fixed instance name in the top module in your
 design. Any other instantiation is invalid.

 Xilinx advises that you verify the correctness of the implementation
 resulting from the use of this UCF file before committing to its use
 as a basis for a board or system level design.  At minimum, you must:

 1. Verify timing closure by performing static timing analysis on a
    fully placed and routed design implemented with this UCF file.

 2. Verify the pin location constraints in this UCF file are compliant
    with the simultaneously switching output (SSO) guidelines for the
    targeted FPGA device and package.

 3. Verify the board level routability of the pin location constraints
    in this UCF file.  Note that the PCI and PCI-X specifications cite
    specific trace length requirements for full compliance.

 The UCF file information provided by Xilinx is provided solely for your
 convenience. Xilinx makes no warranties, and accepts no liability, with
 respect to such information or its use, and any use thereof is solely at
 the risk of the user.  Xilinx does not assume any liability arising out
